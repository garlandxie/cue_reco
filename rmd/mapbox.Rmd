# Metadata

The following notes are from the MapBox Movement Data website (https://www.mapbox.com/movement-data).

## What is MapBox Movement? 

1.  Privacy-forward dataset of device density, activity, and movement

2.  Captures non-driving mobile device activity aggregated into geographic tiles of **100-meter resolution (approx. 1 city block)**

## What can I do with this data? 

1.  Understand relative changes in mobile device activity in space across time

2.  Visualize changes in device density by hour of day, across multiple months or years

## Data features 

1.  High-resolution location accuracy sourced from on-device GPS

2.  Sourced from a diverse mix of thousands of different apps (other data sets are tied to a small number of sources which causes bias in the data)

## How is the data structured and delivered? 

1.  **Monthly activity**

    -   Aggregated by monthly time windows

    -   Provides visibility into hour by hour activity on a typical weekday or weekend in any given months

2.  **Activity index**

    -   Mapbox proprietary density metric which reflects the level of activity in the time window and spatial regions for monthly and daily periods.

    -   It is a decimal value ranging from 0 to 1.

    -   A normalization process is applied to smooth out any effects of extreme outlier activity.

3.  **Data deliverables**

    -   CSV files within an organized file and folder structure naming based on geographic zoom tiles and localized time buckets
